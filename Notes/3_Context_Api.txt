                       ***************************** CONTEXT API ***************************
   --> When there is many component in nesting and we have to pass some data from top level component to the bottom level components.
   --> The the data in initial days of react is passed by using props inside each component present in nesting.
 <DASHBOARD title ="Sneha"/> -->>>>  <RIGHTSIDE title ="Sneha"/> -->>>  <TOPCOM title ="Sneha"/> -->>>  <BOTTOMCOMP title ="Sneha"/>

   --> NOW This prcess is known as " PROP DRILLING ".
       --> To solve this we can make one Global file that contain the global data and accessable by all the components.

                 {
                    title:"Sneha"
                 }

    --> Context Api is used to solve this problem particularly in React.
    --> For all other technologies similar problem is solved by different libraries and Redux.
    --> Redux is used for state management ( Data should be transfered in specific organized format).
    --> React-Redux is used in react.


    ****************************************Creating the Context*********************************************

    PART 1 ---:
        
               --> Create a new file userContext .
               --> Default values can be inserted in the createContext({ Add something that can we default when context is created first })
               --> Create new context inside it using createContext() method and export it.
               --> If we created a context then it will give us "Provider" bcoz every context is a provider.

                                _
               <usercontext>     |
               </usercontext>    |  --> PROVIDER 
                                _|

               <usercontext>          _
                 <LOGIN/>              |
                 <CARD>                |___________>>> childerns
                     <DATA/>           |           >>>    
                 </CARD>              _| 
               </usercontext>

               -->We will wrap the all the component inside the created context which work as a provider.
               --> Now all the components inside the <usercontext> will get the access of the global varible.

    
    PART 2 ---:

               --> Create context provider is made by two methods.
               --> Create new file as userContextProvider .
               --> Make method userContextProvider which have the {childern} passed in it . 
               --> {childern} are passed as it is .
               --> .Provider is the property of userContext which made it a "provider".
               --> Data that can be access is passed inside the value={{object...}}.


    Part 3 ---: 
              --> useContext() is the hook to access the data.

    *************Two file work of ContextApi is done in only one file of the ContextApi_2*************
