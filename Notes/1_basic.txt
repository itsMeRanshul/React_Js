--> React is the library
-->React provides programming capabilities in the html.
-->from app.js we will return the html will is rendered by the index.js
--> No script tag is used in index.html to attach it to the html.
--> react provides react-script to link js to the index html. 

--->> We can return multiple elements in jsx using fragments. <> ... </>
      --> Always capatialize the functions that are to be render.
      --> Jsx is the html written in the javascript.
      --> BUNDLER IS THERE WHICH TAKE THE INFORMATION IN FORM OF FUNCTIONS OR THE JSX AND CONVERT IT INTO OBJECT.
                 const ReactElement={
    type:'a',
    props:{
        href:'https://google.com',
        target:'_blank'
    },
    children:'Click this to visit google .com'
}
     

       -->{name} It is known as the evaluated expressions 
       --> We cannot written the javascript in the evaluated expression.


       **************************** Hooks ************************

          -> multiple data  updation technique of react in UI is done by HOOKS.
            1. useeffect
            2. usereducer
            3. usecontext
            4. useeffect ...

        --> If we have to do the UI updation of multiple elements from core javascript then it will be very complex.

           --> usestate(default value, object, number ,array)
           --> usestate will return two values in form of array [value,function] 
           -->usecallback - we can use the previous data that is kept in the cache which can be used.
           --> usecallback - function data can be used again and again
           --> useref - When we have to take the reference of the some object then we use it

    --> createroot will made the virtual dom and compare it with the browser dom and edit the existing dom of the browser.
    --> While the browser will made the full dom again which will result in the loading.
    -->Reconciliation is the algorithm to which we called the virtual dom.
    -->Reconciliation means updating the dom by comparing them with each other .


                                 ********************PROPS*******************
    --> PROPS will made the component reusable.
    --> Props will make the different value of the single element used multiple time.
    --> We can transfer the value from one component to another.
    -->It has access these value using props using that component
    --> Props is the object from which we can access the values. 


                ***********************CUSTOM HOOKS ND REUSABLE COMPONENTS **************************

                **get to know about this in the currencyconverter project**
        
        -->Custom hooks will always return the js.
        -->It will return the array which contain a variable and function.
        -->useeffect and usestate is used 
        --> useffect is used to mount and unmount or to call the api.
        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@2024-03-06/v1/currencies/usd.json

        --> useeffect will cal again and again when there is a change on dependency array.

        -->component is created for reusability
        -->If you want to use loops in react then be aware of 'KEY'
